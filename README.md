# AvitoParse
-------------------------------------  
All the commits in the master branch!  
-------------------------------------  
Simpliest avito-parser with connection to the telegram. One thing: for parsing such a web-site you need to change standard TLS form requests. Because avito uses the newer TLS-version  
when the python-requests - doesn't. If you don't then you will constantly have "<403 Forbidden>" request!
## Cases of using
As for me, I use such a nice thing to find a rented apartment, find out about renting the fastest and contact the seller.
